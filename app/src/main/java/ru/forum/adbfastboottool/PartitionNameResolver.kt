/**
 * Classifies a payload file name and suggests a likely target partition. Pure,
 * side-effect-free logic used only to *hint* the user — it never selects a partition
 * or authorizes a flash. Final target selection stays with the caller.
 *
 * Custom recovery images rarely follow the `recovery.img` convention: they are named
 * after the project (OrangeFox, TWRP, PBRP, SHRP, RedWolf, ...). On modern A/B devices
 * there is often no dedicated `recovery` partition at all — the recovery ramdisk lives
 * in `boot` / `vendor_boot` / `init_boot`. So for a recovery-brand image we deliberately
 * return a topology-dependent classification with candidate partitions instead of one
 * hard answer; the concrete target must come from the device (getvar:all) and an explicit
 * user choice.
